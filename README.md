## Introduction
Globalwork is a company that develops solutions to optimize selection processes. Provides services of home visits, security studies, background checks and also work well-being services such as business emotional support and virtual home visits for teleworking.

Globalwork has a platform in which precise information is provided on all the candidates in the selection process of each client. However, these technology resources may fail or require adjustments, and there is no centralized environment to help manage them effectively and efficiently.

Thats why together Eliana Gomez, Roger Rendón, Takeshi Ramirez, Juan Torres and Daniel Villa as required by Globalwork, created Globalwork support.

Globalwork support is a web application that helps to manage supports efficiently and effectively.

## Usage
When a Globalwork support user logs in, the application recognizes if is a supporter or not.
If the user is not a supporter, will only have access to a view in which can see the supports made together with their status or make a new support.

If the user is a supporter, when logs in, will access to a view where can manage application users (delete or update them), can update the supports including assigning himself one that is in "pending" status or can simply make new supports.
